    <!-- Make a simple function called greet that returns the most-famous "hello
    world!". Style Points Sure, this is about as easy as it gets. But how clever
    can you be to create the most creative "hello world" you can think of? What
    is a "hello world" solution you would want to show your friends? -->

    <script>
        const greet = () => {return "hello world!"}
        console.log(greet())
